// Animal Legs
// Start with this example problem.

// A quarter of the animals on a farm have four legs. The remaining three quarters of the animals have two legs. If there are 60 legs overall, how many animals are there on the farm?

// Write some JavaScript functions that will allow you to calculate the number of animals when any of the following parameters change.

// Total number of legs
// Percentage of animals with a certain number of legs
// The number of legs for each group
// For example, your functions should be able to solve this variation.

// Forty percent of the animals on a farm have three legs. The remaining 60 percent of the animals have four legs. If there are 180 legs overall, how many animals are there on the farm?

//totalLegs => totalAnimals
//totalAnimals = (1/4(totalAnimals)) + (3/4(totalAnimals))
//

//#num of chickens = 3*pigs
//totalAnimals = pigs + 3*pigs
